A few notes about this homework.

Here are all the files necessary.

The patch hello1.patch is located in examples/hello1.patch. I had some trouble getting the patch, since my whole branch structure didn't seem to work the same. Here's a handy way of making a patch from the last N commits:

git format-patch -N HEAD --stdout > <filename>.patch

Here's the link to where I got this.
