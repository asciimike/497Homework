\section{Exercise Summary}

\noindent Homework 5 is complete except for the o-scope things (I
wasn't on campus this weekend and don't have a good scope at home).\\

\textbf{Objective} & \textbf{Exercise} &\textbf{Status} & \textbf{Notes}\\
\hline
Compile the 3.8 Kernel & Exercise 8 & Completed & I did this in Memo 2,
because it was on the calendar then.\\
\hline
Install necessary cross compilation tools & Exercise 8a & Completed & I did this
in Memo 2,
because it was on the calendar then.\\
\hline
Memmap GPIO access & Exercise 11 & Completed & This is awesome. It also makes
me want to write another layer of abstraction to do GPIO calls, because it's a
bit of a pain.\\
Building the Linux Kernel & Exercise 23 & Completed & Can't wait to start
playing with the Kernel and changing it :) \\

\noindent The main points I took away from these exercises were the following:
\begin{itemize}
 \item I'm really fascinated at how the Linux kernel was created, and how it
accomplishes the tasks it needs to. I'd also be curious to know how small one
could make it in order to put it on smaller and smaller platforms (possibly
even cut into the market of Arduino [especially now that those are starting to
grow in size]).
  \item I feel like taking this class, especially checking out all the
low level code, makes computing feel less high level and abstract, and adds a
concreteness that 
\end{itemize}
