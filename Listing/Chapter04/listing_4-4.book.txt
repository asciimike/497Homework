This is a somewhat larger snippet of listing 4-4 of the book, taken from the 3.8 Kernel on the BeagleBoneBlack. It's largely the same type of stuff, there are just a few more categories of USB devices than there once were. I feel like it's hard to get a good feel for the scale of this file from the original listing, until you actually open the file and realize just how overwhelming it actually is. Glad it's autogenerated...
