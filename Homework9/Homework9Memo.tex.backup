Kernel (3.8.13-bone28).

\section{MatrixLED Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Before writing any code, write a paragraph describing how
boneServer.js and the browser interact in the given example. For example,
in matrixLED.js connect() is called to make a connection between the browser and
the bone. The message “matrix” is sent to the bone. What happens in response
to the message?
  \item What happens when an “LED” is clicked on in the browser?
  \item What entry in matrix.css is used to color the LED?
  \item Write a high level paragraph about how you will control the two
LEDs. What messages will be sent between the browser and the bone?
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
 \item At a high level, the two Javascript files interact via socket.io, which
essentially allows us to send messages between the different files. We have
coupled matrixLED.js and boneServer.js through socket.io, which allows us to
send messages and receive messages [the socket.on(``message'',
callback_function(){function body}] and the  between the different files. When
we send the message matrix to the bone, it goes ahead and pulls in the 8x8 LED
matrix data from the LED matrix, which then sends a ``matrix'' message back to
the client, which updates the colors of the LEDs that are displayed in our
matrix on the client.
  \item When an LED is clicked in the browser, the LEDclick() function is
called, and
